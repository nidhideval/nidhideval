Hi, I’m Nidhi Deval 👋  

I’m an entry-level MIS / Data Analyst with hands-on experience in Excel-based MIS reporting, KPI tracking, dashboards, and exception reporting through practical projects and virtual internships.

I use Python for data cleaning and analysis and am currently building strong foundations in SQL and Power BI for reporting and visualization.

I also maintain guided analytics and machine learning projects to understand end-to-end data workflows and analytical thinking.
